Buffer Button for WordPress

Buffer allows people to share . 

The Buffer Button (https://bufferapp.com/extras/button) is a JavaScript code snippet that allows people browsing your website to share a page through their Buffer account to Twitter or Facebook. Now, copying and pasting JavaScript into a WordPress text widget isn't difficult, but I figured creating and managing multiple Buffer Buttons in a WordPress-powered website over time could be made easier if there was a plugin that helped generate and manage the individual buttons.
